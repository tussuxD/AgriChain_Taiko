# Decentralized Crime Reporting System

## Overview

The Decentralized Crime Reporting System is a web application built on React.js that allows users to report crimes anonymously using the power of blockchain technology. By leveraging the Taiko blockchain and MetaMask for identity management, the system ensures the privacy and security of users while enabling them to submit crime reports seamlessly.

## Features
- User authentication using MetaMask: Users can log in to the system using their MetaMask wallet, ensuring secure and decentralized identity management.
- Anonymous crime reporting: Users can submit crime reports anonymously without revealing their identity, fostering trust and encouraging more people to report incidents.
- Form-based reporting: The system provides a user-friendly form where users can input details about the crime they wish to report, including the type of crime, location, description, and any supporting evidence.
- Blockchain integration: Crime reports are stored on the Taiko blockchain, ensuring immutability, transparency, and tamper resistance. Each report is associated with a unique transaction hash (TXID) for verification and auditing purposes.
- Decentralized data storage: Crime report data is distributed across the Taiko network, eliminating the need for centralized servers and reducing the risk of data breaches or censorship.

## Getting Started
To run the Decentralized Crime Reporting System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tussuxD/AgriChain_Taiko
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    cd decentralized-crime-reporting-system
    npm install
3. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
    npm start

4. Open the application in your web browser:
